This is a basic molecular dynamics simulation, symmetric stretch of a 3 particle system with the
same mass with the assumption that energy is conserved.

It follows Hookes law as the basis of deriving the potential and subsequently the
force acting on each particle.

The integration follows the easy to understand Euler method :)

Much of this is in reference to this wonderful paper:
